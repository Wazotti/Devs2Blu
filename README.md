# Presentation

   Hello, how are you? My name is Maria Clara Mazotti, I'm 17 years old and I've been studying programming since 2020, when I started during the pandemic. 
 Since then, I've been dedicating myself to languages ​​like Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and a little bit of MySQL. 
   Although I've learned a lot on my own, I always miss the face-to-face experience, having someone by my side to answer questions and give me more guidance. 
currently work as a Young Apprentice in IT. Although I'm gaining experience, my big dream is to pursue a career in companies like Sênior Sistemas and, 
in the future, get an opportunity in large technology companies, like Google. 
  I hope to grow professionally from the +Devs2Blu course, make the most of the learning and all the opportunities it can offer me. 
I'm very motivated to develop myself and turn this opportunity into a big step for my future.
