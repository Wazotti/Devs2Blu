# 📝About Me

   Hello, how are you? My name is Maria Clara Mazotti, I'm 17 years old and I've been studying programming since 2020, when I started during the pandemic. 
 Since then, I've been dedicating myself to languages ​​like Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and a little bit of MySQL. 
   Although I've learned a lot on my own, I’ve always missed the in-person experience, having someone by my side to answer questions and give me more guidance. 
I currently work as a Young Apprentice in IT. Although I’m gaining valuable experience, my big dream is to pursue a career at a technology company that values 
innovation and growth. In the future, I hope to get an opportunity at a major global company, like Google. 
  I hope to grow professionally through the +Devs2Blu course, make the most of the learning, and take advantage of all the opportunities it offers me. 
I’m highly motivated to develop myself and turn this opportunity into a big step toward my future.
